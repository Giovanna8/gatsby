Imagine for a moment the perfect website framework. One that produced
really fast sites by default, that let you use the latest web tools and
browser features without complicated setup, and that would expose this
all this through a thoughtfully designed set of APIs that let your team
always build exactly what you intend with a minimum of fuss.

This framework would have to be:

* **universal**, work for all types of sites from simple brocurewares to
complex webapps.
* **simple**, not requiring any setup to start using and with thoughtful
APIs to extend the framework.
* **fast**, take advantage of HTTP/2, browser caching, service workers,
inlined critical css, and code splitting so your site always loads
incredibly fast.
* **team ready**, use industry standard collaboration tools like NPM,
Git, and continous deployment, so your team is always on the same page
and shipping new features is easy.

## Why Gatsby is great

* Fast!
* Fun!

## This is why I'm working on it full-time

* It's the future!
* The internet is a intensely competative place — nexus of that
  competition is in javascript.

## This is what's new in 1.0

* This
* that
