Imagine for a moment the perfect website framework. One that produced
really fast sites by default, that let you use the latest web tools and
browser features without complicated setup, and that would expose this
all through a thoughtfully designed set of APIs that lets your team
always build exactly what you intend with a minimum of fuss.

This framework would have to be:

* **universal**, work for all types of sites from simple brocurewares to
complex webapps.
* **simple**, not requiring any setup to start using and with thoughtful
APIs to extend the framework.
* **fast**, take advantage of HTTP/2, browser caching, service workers,
inlined critical css, and code splitting so your site always loads
incredibly fast—no matter what you build.
* **Javascript-driven**, the web is huge and intensely competative.
Sites that win are fast and richly interactive. Your framework must make
it trivial to use advanced Javascript.
* **team ready**, use industry standard collaboration tools like NPM,
Git, and continous deployment, so your team is always on the same page
and shipping new features is easy.
* **internet scale**, launch your site to millions without crashing your
site (or your wallet).
* **secure**, don't put your your users data at risk of hacking.

I believe that Gatsby fulfills these requirements. After several years
of working on the project and seeing it used by many people on a wide
variety of sites, I'm confident that Gatsby works and is the most
exciting tool in 2017 for building websites.

Since I open sourced Gatsby in 2014, it's collected over **8000** stars on
Github (by far the most stars on Github for a project of its type) and
been downloaded **130,000** times!

In mid-2016, I decided to [go full-time on
Gatsby](https://www.bricolage.io/gatsby-open-source-work/) and started
researching and prototyping ideas that are now coming together as Gatsby
1.0.

Read on for an intro to what's coming in 1.0.
